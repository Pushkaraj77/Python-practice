# Operators in python

print("1. Arithmetic Operators")
''' operators like :
+ Addition 
- Substraction
* Multiply
/ Divide
% Modulus
** Exponent
// Floor Division
'''
n1 = 1
n2 = 3
print(n1+n2)

print("2. Assignment Operators")
'''
Assigns new value to already existing variable 

Operators like :
+= add and assign
-= subtract and assign
*= multilpy and assign
/ divide and assign
%= modulus and assign
**= exponent and assign
//= floor divide and assign
&= bitwise AND and assign
|= bitwise OR and assign
^= bitwise XOR and assign (only if)
<<= bitwise left shit and assign
>>= bitwise right shit and assign
'''

n3= 7
n3+=3
print(n3)

print("3. Comparison Operators")
'''
Compares two statements or variables

Operators like :
== Equal
!= Not equal
< Less than
> More than
<= Less than or equal
>= More than or equalo
'''
n4=6
n5=9
print(n4<n5)

print("4. Logical Operators")
'''
Logic in arguments

Operators like :
and - both true
or - one true
not - Negation
'''
print(n4<7 and n5< 10)

print("5. identity Operators")
'''
To return if the argument is true or false

Operators like :
is - returns true if both values are same
is not - returns true if both values are not same
'''
a=7
b=6
print(a is b)

print("6. Membership Operators")
'''
Checks if the required sequence or character exists in the list

Operators like :
in - returns true if the character is in the list
not in - returns true if the character is not in the list
'''
list = [3,4,5,39,33,35,32]
print(32 in list)

print("7. Bitwise Operators")
'''
Binary code based operators

Operators like :

& AND 
| OR
^ XOR
~ NOT
<< Zero shift left
>> Zero shift right

0=00
1=01
2=10
3=11
'''
print(1 & 3)
